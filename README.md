# AI-Agent-System
## The AI-Powered Intelligent Agent System is designed to automate decision-making workflows using agent-based AI. The system utilizes CrewAI and AutoGen frameworks to build intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. It provides a scalable, serverless REST API using FastAPI and is deployed on AWS Lambda to ensure high availability and performance. The system also integrates reinforcement learning techniques to improve agent interactions over time.

### Requirements

# 1. Functional Requirements

## 1.1 Intelligent Agent System

- Implement multiple AI agents that interact and collaborate to solve tasks.

- Each agent should have a specific role and decision-making capability.

- Support both rule-based and learning-based decision-making.

- Allow dynamic task allocation and agent communication.

## 1.2 REST API for AI Model Integration

- Expose a FastAPI-based RESTful API for external applications to integrate AI agent capabilities.

- Provide endpoints for task execution, agent status retrieval, and workflow management.

- Implement JWT-based authentication for secure API access.

## 1.3 Reinforcement Learning & Optimization

- Utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to improve agent responses over time.

- Implement feedback loops to adjust agent decision-making strategies.

- Allow customization of RL algorithms and hyperparameters.

## 1.4 Deployment & Scalability

- Deploy the system on AWS Lambda for serverless execution.

- Integrate with AWS API Gateway for handling HTTP requests.

- Store persistent data using AWS DynamoDB or S3.

- Ensure horizontal scaling and efficient request handling.

# 2. Non-Functional Requirements

## 2.1 Performance & Scalability

- API response time should be < 500ms for standard requests.

- Handle concurrent agent executions efficiently.

- Optimize compute resource utilization on AWS Lambda.

## 2.2 Security & Compliance

- Secure API endpoints using OAuth2/JWT authentication.

- Encrypt stored data using AES-256 encryption.

- Ensure compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations.

## 2.3 Maintainability & Extensibility

- Use a modular design for easy maintenance and expansion.

- Provide detailed logging and error-handling mechanisms.

- Ensure 99.9% uptime with robust error recovery strategies.
